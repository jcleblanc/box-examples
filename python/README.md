# Box Python Examples
The following samples and applications are designed for working with the Box APIs through raw HTTPS requests and the [Python SDK](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk). The following apps and samples are available:

  * **representations_single_image**: A sample application which uses the Representations API to download image representations of each page of a given file (e.g. an image for each slide in a Powerpoint presentation). Images are downloaded and stored locally. 
  * **representations_watermark**: A sample application which uses the Representations API to download a watermarked PDF.
  * **samples**: A series of general samples for performing specific actions with the Box SDK.
